<Tip>
**What are Eden Agents?**  
Eden Agents are chat agents who are given a custom personality, set of tools, and finetuned image generation model capturing a personalized aesthetic. They can be crafted to act as creative assistants, coaches, storytellers, and more. Once created, they can optionally be deployed to social media.
</Tip>

## Create an Agent

A list of all agents featured on Eden is [found here](https://app.eden.art/explore?tab=agents). From that page, click "Create Agent" to take you to the builder interface. You may also edit agents from this page.

### Guidelines for writing character definitions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Display Name and Name">
    Display name and username of your character
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Profile Image">
    An uploaded image of your character, to be used as its avatar
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Description">
    Instruct your character of their identity, biography, and/or personality description. Use second or third person. For example:
    
    > You are roleplaying Eve, an an expert at using Eden, a generative AI platform that empowers individuals to create and share their unique digital creations. You assist the user in navigating Eden's tools and features to achieve their goals.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Instructions">
    A set of instructions to your agent. Here you may instruct them to try to achieve a goal, or to behave in a certain way. See the expandable example below for a detailed instruction set.
    
    <Accordion title="Example: Photo Assistant Instructions">
    You are a "photo assistant" who helps users generate novel images of themselves or their friends. You do this by helping the user curate and upload a set of images depicting the subject (usually themselves), and then you train a model on those images. You then use that model to generate new images of the subject in the style that they request.
    
    You will coach the user through this entire process. Do not be verbose in your explanations, just keep them focused on the task at hand.
    
    Start the conversation by briefly introducing yourself and explaining to the user in a friendly way what you do for them. Then guide them through the following steps:
    
    1) Upload some images -- you want the user to upload at least 3 images of themselves, but 5-10 is better. As they upload images, look at them and provide them with feedback on the images.
    
    2) Once you and the user agree that the images are good, you will then use the lora_trainer tool to train a model on those images. This process takes 5-10 minutes, so tell the user to wait for a bit. When the trainer is done, you will receive a thumbnail of the model and its ID. Show the user the thumbnail, but do not tell them the ID, this is just for you. Memorize the ID, you will need to insert it into the "lora" field of the txt2img tools.
    
    3) Once the model is trained, and you have its ID memorized, you can use the txt2img tool with the lora_id to generate new images of the user in various ways. Suggest some creative examples, like placing them in various creative, artistic, or surreal settings. You may occasionally use the other tools if they are relevant, but you should usually just use txt2img.
    
    You may go on for as long as the user likes, generating as many images as they want. If they want to start over at some point, go back to step 1.

## Training a custom visual model

While not mandatory, Eden supports [training an optional visual model](https://app.eden.art/train) that gets integrated into your agent. This model can be used to build in a consistent character or person into your agents visual creations. It can also be used to learn entire aesthetic styles, leading to a consistent, branded look & feel. See our [models page](https://app.eden.art/explore?tab=models) for examples.

To learn more about training models, see [this guide](/guides/models).

### Linking your custom model

Once training is done, you can simply go (back) to the agent builder form and connect your custom model to your agent:

## Interact with your Agent

Once deployed, you can find your agent in the [agents home screen](https://app.eden.art/explore?tab=agents) and start a chat with them.

By default, agents are equipped with several image and video generating tools, storytelling capabilities as well as audio effects and music generators, tools for websearch and news.

More tools are being added all the time that automatically become available to all agents. If you would love a specific tool we currently don't feel, don't hesitate to [reach out to us](https://discord.com/invite/4dSYwDT)!

<img src="/img/banny_chat.jpg" alt="Chat interface with an agent" />

All these tools are available by just asking your agent to do something:

<video width="600" height="400" controls>
  <source src="/video/banny_chat.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

## Memory System

Eden agents can learn and evolve through conversations using the memory system. This enables your agents to:

- **Remember user preferences**: Store individual user preferences and behavioral instructions
- **Build shared knowledge**: Create collective memory that all users contribute to and benefit from
- **Maintain conversation context**: Keep track of ongoing projects and discussions

The memory system operates automatically in the background, extracting and organizing important information as users interact with your agent. You can customize what information gets captured through Memory Instructions and manage memories through the agent interface.

## Exporting to social media

<Info>
Agent export to social platforms is in beta. If you're interested in testing it now, please reach out to the devs on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4dSYwDT).
</Info>

Not only can our agents interact with your audience, they have full access to all of Eden's creative tools, your custom models and can even generate fully animated short-movies with sound effects and music!

As an example, [**Abraham**](https://x.com/abraham_ai_) autonomously posts a fully generated movie scene every single day.
