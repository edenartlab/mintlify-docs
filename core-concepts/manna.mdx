## Manna subscriptions

Users are encouraged to [sign up for a subscription plan](https://app.eden.art/settings/subscription), which gives them access to various premium features and a regular replenishment of manna each month.

### How subscriptions work

<Note>
In the beginning of each month, remaining subscription manna expire and are restored to the top of the subscription plan's full amount. For example, Pro subscribers reset to 5000 manna.
</Note>

- **Subscription Manna**: Replenishes monthly and expires at the end of each month
- **Top-up Manna**: Purchased ad-hoc manna that never expires
- **Spending order**: You always spend subscription Manna first, and only begin to spend non-expiring Manna once subscription Manna is depleted.
