<Info>
Deployments are experimental and currently in private beta. If you're interested in testing it now, please reach out to the devs on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4dSYwDT).
</Info>

Users who have been granted access to the deployment beta will notice a "Deployments" section in each Agent's settings. Through this interface, you can deploy your agent to Discord or [Telegram](/integrations/telegram).

## Setup Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Discord Application">
    ### Create application in Discord
    
    Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application.
    
    <img src="/img/discord1.jpg" alt="Select 'New Application'" />
    
    Give your application a name (e.g. "My Agent") and click "Create". For convenience, use the same name as your agent.
    
    In "General Information":
    - Upload your agent's profile image to App Icon
    - Click 'Save' to save the changes

    ### Configure Bot Settings
    
    1. Click "Bot" on the left sidebar
    2. Click "Reset Token" to generate a new token and copy it somewhere safe

    <Warning>
    If you ever reset or revoke the token, your bot will stop working. You can always generate a new token and paste it again into Eden.
    </Warning>
    
    3. Scroll down to "Privileged Gateway Intents" and enable:
       - Presence Intent
       - Server Members Intent  
       - Message Content Intent
    
    Click "Save Changes" after enabling these permissions.

    ### Set Up Allowed Channels
    
    First, enable Developer Mode in Discord:
    
    <Tabs>

        <img src="/img/discord/_100001.jpg" alt="User settings" style={{width: '40%'}} />
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Step 2: Enable Developer Mode">
        Search for "developer" and activate developer mode in advanced settings:
        <img src="/img/discord/_100002.jpg" alt="Developer mode" />
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    
    To add channels:
    1. Right-click any channel name in Discord
    2. Select "Copy Channel ID"
    3. Add the ID to "Allowed Channels" in Eden
    4. Add a label for the channel so you remember it
    
    <img src="/img/discord/_100000.jpg" alt="Copy Channel ID" style={{width: '20%'}} />
    
    Click "Deploy" when you're done.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Bot to Server">
    After successful deployment:
    
    1. Copy the "Invite Bot to Server" link from Eden
    2. Paste it into a browser
    3. Select your server and add the bot
    
    <img src="/img/discord/discord1.jpg" alt="Invite link" />
    
    Your bot will show as "Online" in your Discord server sidebar when ready.
    
    <img src="/img/discord/discord2.jpg" alt="Bot online status" style={{width: '40%'}} />
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Testing Your Agent

Go to one of the allowed channels and mention your bot in a message. If it responds, you're all set!

## Troubleshooting
