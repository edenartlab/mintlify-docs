<Tip>
**What is Shopify Integration?**  
Eden's Shopify integration allows you to programmatically create and manage products in your Shopify store. This enables automated product creation, inventory management, and store operations through Eden's AI-powered tools.
</Tip>

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Shopify integration, you'll need:

- A Shopify store (either a paid plan or Shopify Plus)
- Admin access to your Shopify store
- Basic understanding of Shopify's admin interface

## Setup Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Private App">
    ### Log into Shopify Admin
    
    Go to your Shopify store's admin panel. If you need to create a new Shopify store:
    - Go to [accounts.shopify.com](https://accounts.shopify.com/)
    - Sign up and create a store
    
    Navigate to **Settings** → **Apps and sales channels**
    
    ### Create the app
    
    1. Click on **Develop apps** (or **Manage private apps** for older stores)
    2. Click **Allow custom app development** if not already selected

    4. Give your app a name (e.g., "Eden Integration")
    5. Select your email as the developer email
    6. Click **Create app**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Permissions">
    ### Set API scopes
    
    1. Click **Configure Admin API scopes**
    2. Enable the following permissions:
       - **Products**: `read_products`, `write_products`
       - **Inventory**: `read_inventory`, `write_inventory`
       - **Locations**: `read_locations`, `write_locations`
       - **Publications**: `read_publications`, `write_publications`
    3. Click **Save**
    
    ### Install the app
    
    1. Click **Install app** to install it on your store
    2. Confirm the installation
    
    <Note>
    You may need to close and reopen settings for the install button to enable.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Get Your Credentials">
    ### Access Token
    
    After installing:
    1. In your app's overview page, find **Admin API access token**
    2. Click **Reveal token once**
    3. **Copy immediately** - you won't see it again!
    4. The token should start with `shpat`
    
    ### Store Name
    
    Your store name is the subdomain of your Shopify store.  
    Example: For `mystore.myshopify.com`, your store name is `mystore`
    
    <img src="/img/shopify/store-name.png" alt="Store name example" style={{width: '50%'}} />
    
    ### Location ID
    
    1. Go to **Settings** → **Locations**
    2. Select your primary location
    3. Note the **Location ID** from the URL (numeric value at the end)
    
    <img src="/img/shopify/store-location.png" alt="Store location ID" style={{width: '50%'}} />
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Eden Agent">
    Configure the corresponding variables for your Eden agent deployment:
    
    <img src="/img/shopify/agent-deployment.png" alt="Agent configuration" style={{width: '75%'}} />
