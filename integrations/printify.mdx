<Tip>
**What is Printify Integration?**  
Eden's Printify integration allows you to programmatically create and manage print-on-demand products through Printify's network of print providers. This enables automated product creation, design management, and fulfillment through Eden's AI-powered tools.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Printify is a drop-shipping service and will use its own connection to Shopify. This replaces the Eden Shopify integration. The Eden Shopify integration is best suited for physical goods where you have inventory on-hand.
</Warning>

## Understanding Printify Products

Printify products consist of:

  <Tab title="Components">
    - **Base Product**: The physical item (t-shirt, mug, poster, etc.)
    - **Print Provider**: The company that prints and fulfills your products
    - **Design**: Your artwork or text that gets printed on the product
    - **Variants**: Different sizes, colors, or styles of the same product
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Templates">
    Your agent has access to Eden's physical item & print provider template lists and can generate products according to these. Alternatively, browse the Printify catalog from your dashboard and request specific items.
