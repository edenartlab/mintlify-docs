    </Tip>
  </Step>

    Go to your agent's deployment settings:
    1. Select **Telegram**
    2. Paste the token into the "Token" field

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Up Allowed Channels">
    You need to specify which channels (groups/topics) the bot can chat in.
    
    To get channel IDs, visit the channel in [Telegram Web](https://web.telegram.org/) and inspect the URL.
    
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Groups without topics">
        Copy everything after the last slash and #.  
        Format: `-some_number`  
        Example: `-4656194598`
        
        <img src="/img/telegram/telegram1.jpg" alt="Group ID format" />
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab title="Groups with topics">
        Copy everything after the last slash.  
        Format: `-100` + `some_number` + `_some_string`  
        
        <Note>
        If your URL has `/k/`, try changing it to `/a/` instead.
        </Note>
        
        Example: `-1002429164874_30`
        
        <img src="/img/telegram/telegram2.jpg" alt="Topic group ID format" />
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    
    Add these IDs to "Allowed Channels" for each channel you want your bot to access.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Deploy and Test">
    1. Click **Deploy**
    2. Wait for deployment confirmation
    3. Try mentioning your bot in an allowed channel
    
    <Warning>
    The deployment may show as "successful" a few minutes before it's actually ready. If successful but not responding, please wait a few more minutes.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tool

Go to one of the allowed channels and mention your bot in a message. If it responds, you're all set!

## Using the Telegram Tools

The following tools are available for your agent to use once it is deployed to Telegram:
- `telegram_post` - Post a message to a channel

You can use these in a conversation with your agent.

## Getting Channel IDs

### Quick Reference

| Channel Type | ID Format | Example |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| Regular Group | `-number` | `-4656194598` |
| Group with Topics | `-100number_string` | `-1002429164874_30` |

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Use [Telegram Web](https://web.telegram.org/) to get IDs
- For topic groups, ensure URL uses `/a/` not `/k/`
- Double-check the bot has been added to the group
- Verify privacy mode is disabled in BotFather
