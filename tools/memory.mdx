## Parameters

### Required Parameters

<ParamField body="instruction" type="string" required>
  The instruction used to update the agent memory, which can both add, delete or update information

    Format instructions as clear, specific directives about behavioral changes or preferences.
    Good examples:

    - "ALWAYS REPLY IN ALL-CAPS"
    - "Address the user as Professor [Name] and maintain formal academic language"
    - "Always ask for confirmation before triggering a video tool"
    
    Bad examples:
