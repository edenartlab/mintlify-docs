<ParamField body="emotion" type="string" default="[0.30, 0.03, 0.03, 0.03, 0.03, 0.03, 0.25, 0.30]">
  Emotion vector for the generated speech

  <Tip>
    Encodes emotion in an 8D vector. Included emotions are Happiness, Sadness, Disgust, Fear, Surprise, Anger, Other, Neutral in that order. This vector tends to be entangled with various other conditioning inputs. More notably, it's entangled with text based on the text sentiment (eg. Angry texts will be more effectively conditioned to be angry, but if you try to make it sound sad it will be a lot less effective). It's also entangled with pitch standard deviation since larger values there tend to correlate to more emotional utterances. Make sure to always surround the emotion vector with quotes to avoid list-parsing!
